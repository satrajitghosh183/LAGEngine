# LAG Engine

## 🚀 Overview

LAG Engine is a custom-built game development framework designed from first principles, focused on:

- **Dual-dimension architecture** supporting both 2D and 3D physics simulations
- **Realistic physics simulation** using Verlet integration
- **Advanced cloth dynamics** with tearing and deformation
- **Modular component-based design** for extensibility
- **Optimized rendering pipeline** using modern OpenGL
- **Foundation for AI integration** and complex agent behaviors

Built as an academic research project, LAG Engine demonstrates how fundamental simulation concepts can be implemented without relying on existing game engines, providing unparalleled control and flexibility.

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have installed:
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, or MSVC 19.14+)
- CMake 3.16 or higher
- SFML 2.5 development libraries
- OpenGL development libraries

### Option 1: Using the Build Script (Recommended)
The easiest way to build LAG Engine is using the provided build script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/satrajitghosh183/LAGEngine.git
cd LAGEngine

# Make the build script executable
chmod +x build_game_engine.sh

# Run the build script
./build_game_engine.sh
```

This script will:
- Create and clean the build directory
- Run CMake to configure the project
- Build the project using the appropriate system commands
- Report any errors if they occur

### Option 2: Manual Build

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install cmake libsfml-dev libglm-dev libglfw3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/satrajitghosh183/LAGEngine.git
cd LAGEngine

# Create build directory
mkdir -p build
cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make
```

#### Windows
```bash
# Install dependencies via vcpkg
vcpkg install sfml glm glfw3

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/satrajitghosh183/LAGEngine.git
cd LAGEngine

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure and build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build .
```

### Troubleshooting Common Build Issues

If you encounter build issues, try the following:

1. **SFML not found**: Ensure SFML development libraries are installed and findable by CMake
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
   
   # macOS
   brew install sfml
   
   # Windows (vcpkg)
   vcpkg install sfml
   ```

2. **OpenGL issues**: Make sure OpenGL development libraries are installed
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
   ```

3. **CMake version too old**: Update CMake to version 3.16 or newer
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install cmake
   
   # macOS
   brew install cmake
   ```

4. **Compiler errors**: Ensure you're using a C++17 compatible compiler
   ```bash
   # Check GCC version
   gcc --version
   
   # Check Clang version
   clang --version
   ```
